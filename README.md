# dispensa

A an app for tracking grocery type expenses.  It was created to replace the excel file my wife and I used to track our expenses; giving me a chance to learn and put into practice some front-end web tecnologies I had wanted to learn.

## Build & development

Run `npm update`, then `bower update` and finally `npm start --`
